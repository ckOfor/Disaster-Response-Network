# Disaster Response Network Smart Contract

## Overview

The Disaster Response Network is a decentralized blockchain-based platform designed to facilitate coordinated disaster relief efforts. It enables disaster registration, fund donation, response team coordination, and transparent aid proposal management.

## Key Features

- Disaster Registration
- Donation Mechanism
- Response Team Management
- Aid Proposal Creation and Voting
- Transparent Fund Allocation
- Reputation Tracking for Response Teams

## Core Components

### Disasters
- Unique identification
- Location and fund requirements
- Active status tracking
- Fundraising progress monitoring

### Response Teams
- Team registration
- Reputation-based system
- Proposal submission capabilities

### Aid Proposals
- Proposal creation
- Community voting
- Execution mechanism
- Fund distribution

## Main Functions

### `register-disaster`
- **Purpose**: Register a new disaster relief effort
- **Parameters**:
    - `name`: Disaster name
    - `location`: Disaster location
    - `funds-required`: Total funds needed

### `donate-to-disaster`
- **Purpose**: Contribute funds to a specific disaster relief effort
- **Parameters**:
    - `disaster-id`: Unique disaster identifier
    - `amount`: Donation amount

### `register-response-team`
- **Purpose**: Register a new disaster response team
- **Parameters**:
    - `name`: Team name

### `create-aid-proposal`
- **Purpose**: Submit an aid proposal for a specific disaster
- **Parameters**:
    - `disaster-id`: Target disaster
    - `amount`: Proposed aid amount

### `vote-on-proposal`
- **Purpose**: Vote on an existing aid proposal

### `execute-proposal`
- **Purpose**: Execute an approved aid proposal

## Error Handling

- `err-not-found` (u100): Resource not found
- `err-unauthorized` (u101): Unauthorized action
- `err-insufficient-funds` (u102): Funding constraints violated

## Workflow Example

```clarity
;; Register a disaster
(register-disaster "Hurricane Relief" "Caribbean" u100000)

;; Donate to the disaster
(donate-to-disaster disaster-id u5000)

;; Register a response team
(register-response-team "Global Rescue Squad")

;; Create an aid proposal
(create-aid-proposal disaster-id u25000)

;; Vote on the proposal
(vote-on-proposal proposal-id)

;; Execute the proposal
(execute-proposal proposal-id)
```

## Security Measures

- Strict authorization checks
- Funds transfer validation
- Proposal voting requirements
- Active disaster status verification

## Potential Improvements

- Multi-signature proposal execution
- More complex reputation calculation
- Time-based proposal expiration
- Partial fund release mechanisms

## Deployment Considerations

- Ensure sufficient contract STX balance
- Comprehensive testing on testnet
- Clear communication of contract mechanics
